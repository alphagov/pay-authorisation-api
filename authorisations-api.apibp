# GOV.UK Pay Payment Authorisation

The GOV.UK Pay Payment Authorisation API is an enhancement to the existing
GOV.UK Pay API which allows services to submit the full Card PAN, CVV,
Cardholder Name and Expiry Date via API in order to authorise a payment. This
is particularly useful for services who operate PCI compliant IVR telephony
systems and want to integrate both their digital payments and telephone
payments with GOV.UK Pay.



## Payments [/v1/payments]

## Initiate a payment journey for API authorisation [POST]

A new field can now be passed at payment creation time to specify how you intend the payment to be authorised.
This can take one of two values:

| authorisation_mode | How the interaction happens |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| `web` (default)    | Via a paying user interaction with GOV.UK Pay's payment pages |
| `moto_api`         | By providing card details through an API call |

The `web` option represents the existing means by which payments are authorised on Pay: we return 
you a `next_url` to which the user should be redirected.

The new option is `moto_api`.
To use the `moto_api` mode for authorisation, your systems will by definition
be processing sensitive cardholder data governed by PCI-DSS rules. Therefore 
this mode of use is suitable only in certain circumstances. A common use case will be 
service teams who have a PCI compliant call centre/IVR solution provided by the supplier,
where you wish to integrate the IVR system with GOV.UK Pay for payment processing in addition
to processing online payments via GOV.UK Pay.

If you specify `authorisation_mode` as `moto_api`, then you no longer need to provide
a `return_url` since there is no longer a user to return. In this case, the response
will include a link called `auth_url_post`, which specifies a url and a `continuation_token`.
These values should be used to compose your authorisation request.

## Submit a payment for authorisation and capture [/auth]

## Submit a payment for authorisation and capture [POST]

This endpoint does not require the standard API Bearer token provided to the
`api.payments.service.gov.uk` endpoint.

Instead it can only be used by generating a single-use token via the Create 
payment endpoint (`POST /v1/payments`) and specifying the `api_mode` parameter 
as `moto_api`.
This will be hosted the subdomain at `https://auth.payments.service.gov.uk`.

This endpoint will process the submitted payment details synchronously, and both authorise and capture
the payment.
Depending on the PSP this call can take 1-2 seconds, and sometimes longer in busy periods.
Requests will timeout after 10 seconds. 
Requests for a given `continuation_token` cannot be retried.

Upon completion the payment will be in one of the following [states](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/#status-and-finished):

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `success` | The payment was authorised successfully and sent for capture |
| `failed` | Payment was unsuccessful. No money is taken (although the user may see an authorisation which will be reverted/cancelled). This could be due to a number of reasons, including timeout, insufficient funds, invalid card details. The failure reason is further indicated by the [`code` parameter](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/api_reference/#errors-caused-by-payment-statuses) in the response |
| `error` | An unexpected error occurred either with the underlying PSP or with GOV.UK Pay. No money is taken. |
